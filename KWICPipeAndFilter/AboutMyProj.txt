1. I use JAVA to do my project.

2. I applied parallel processing in my project, each filter is a thread.

3. Three are a input file that contains the inputs:

Pipe and Filter
Software Architecture in Practice

4. The noise file contains two words that are 'and', 'a'. The DeleteStopword filter will delete the ouput lines that start with 'and','a','AND','A'.

5. The output file will be created after run the project, it will contain the output lines.

6. The UpperTransform filter will convert the first word of a line to upper letters.

7. The order of filters is Input-UpperTransform-CircularShifter-Alphabetizer-UpperTransform-DeleteStopword-Output

8. KWICSystem class is is the main function, it will call KWICStarter. KWICStarter will instantiate the Pipe objects and connect each filter. It also start the threads.

9. Filter is the parrent class which implements Runnable interface.

10. Pipe is a pipe that contain PipeReader and PipeWriter.
